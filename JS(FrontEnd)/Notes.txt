1. DOM (Document Object Model)
   - Tree like representation of your HTML Document.
   - Each Element from HTML Document is called as "node" in the DOM Tree.
   - Collection of node is also called DOM.
   - The tree like structure is in the form of a hierarchy Model.
   - It is a bridge between your HTML and javascript.
   - If we use JS to manipulate the style content then it will be a Inline Approach.


2. Events
   - These are triggers
   - When a user triggers something on the page, Based on the trigger some action gets executed.
   - 106+ Events are present.


3. jQuery(JavaScript Query)
   - It is a library based on JS. This library is used since it gives us more with very
     less coding "Write Less Do More".
   - Before the Document is loaded the jQuery will not be executed.
   - Approaches to implement jQuery.
     - cdn Approach.
     - Having a local copy of the jQuery library.
   - Syntax
     - $(selector).action() or $(fuction(){ Statement or jQuery methods })
     - where, $ is used to access the jQuery library and also to define.


4. Asyn Communication
   - Concurrency
     - One after the other execution (Js behaves sync in the front end).

   - Callback Function
     - It is a fuction which is passed as an arguement to another function.
     - Which is similar to recursive fuction and iterative function.

   - Callback Chaining
     - chain multiple Callbacks together, where the ouput of one fuction triggers the next one.
     - Callback Chaining is a pattern in asynchronous programming.

   - Callback Hell
     - Whenever you have multiple callbacks it may leads to callback hell.
     - It is a situation where the flow looks like executing in a direction that was called but infact it is opposite.
     - To overcome such a situation pormise was introduced.

   - Promise
     - It is a method which was introduced to overcome the problems that were faced while using multiple callbacks.
     - Promise is asynchronous.
     - Every Promise has 4 state, namely
       - pending    - Promise is invoked but we dont have the solution yet.
       - rejected   - Promise is invoked but it generated an error.
       - Fullfilled - Promise is invoked and the result is also generated/ the Promise is resolved.
       - Settled    - Promise which was invoked has outcome (can be error or resolved).
     - Promise have two method
       - then method
       - catch method - it is used to handle error generated by the promise.
     - Promise.all()
       - It is a method which takes an iterable (like an array) of promises and returns a single promise.
     - async and await
       - async - This will trigger a function asynchronously and it will return a promise.
       - await - This keyword is used to make the function wait. Until it receives a resolve from a promise it will wait.


5. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Portocol)
   - Used to transfer data accross the web.
   - Used in client server communication model.
   - HTTP Response Codes
     - 1xx - Informational Status Codes.
     - 2xx - Successful.
     - 3xx - Multiple Choice.
     - 4xx - Client Error.
     - 5xx - Server Error.
